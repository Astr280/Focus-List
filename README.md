I'm excited to share that Iâ€™ve developed a sleek, minimalist to-do list app with a clean interface and smooth animations.

Smooth task addition and completion transitions
Task categorization for better organization
Local storage to save tasks between sessions
Fully responsive across all screen sizes
The app focuses on providing a simple and intuitive user experience with beautiful transitions and a soft color palette. I'm continuing to refine the design and add new features.
